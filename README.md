# Sheepy's Phoenix Point Mods

Source Codes of my mods for [Phoenix Point](https://phoenixpoint.info/), [Snapshot Games](http://www.snapshotgames.com/) 2019.
DLLs are latest build and are less well-tested than those on NexusMods.
You can find NexusMods links below.

Unless otherwise noted, my mods tries not to modify game data,
meaning they shouldn't taint your save.
In other words, savegames made with the mods active should be safe to load when the mods are disabled.

Mods will be added as they are updated and optimised for [Modnix](https://github.com/Sheep-y/Modnix).

Some [unpublished mods](https://github.com/Sheep-y/PhoenixPt-Mods/tree/master/Unpublished) not found on NexusMods,
usually custom jobs or for self use, can be found here.

## Loader Compatibility

All published mods are tested with [Modnix](https://github.com/Sheep-y/Modnix),
and usually also with [PPML v0.1](https://github.com/RealityMachina/PhoenixPointModInjector/#readme).

All my mods are *incompatible* with [PPML v0.2](https://github.com/Ijwu/PhoenixPointModLoader/#readme) found on [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/phoenixpoint/mods/38).
Because of how PPML v0.2 is designed, mods must choose one to support.

* 0.1 mods will be ignored by 0.2.
* 0.2 and 0.3 mods will *crash* PPML 0.1.

Since 0.1 is still used by old mods, and many players are not experts in mod management,
I opt for having my mods not work rather than crashing the game, when they are used incorrectly.
Thanks for your understanding.

(PPML 0.3 can load 0.1 mods, but mod that base itself on 0.3 would still crash PPML 0.1.)

## Compiling

Steps to build your own dlls from the source code.

1. Make sure the game is installed in `C:\Program Files\Epic Games\PhoenixPoint`.  The mods need to reference its dlls.
2. Download Visual Studio 2019, select ".Net Desktop Development" in the Installer.
3. Download the [whole repo](https://github.com/Sheep-y/PhoenixPt-Mods/archive/master.zip) and extract to a folder.
4. Double click `PhoenixPt_Mods.sln`.  This should open all the mods in Visual Studio.
5. Switch to "Release" build.  Debug will not build.
6. In Build menu, click "Build Solution".  For the first build you need to be online, and it may take a while.
7. Not all mods can be built with the latest Phoenix Point.  Legacy mods may need old dlls to build.
8. Project build script will move successfully built dlls to the `distro` folder.

If things are not fine, well, you need programming skill to solve it.
We need modders. Come join us!

## Tech Tree

Yup, I made the first complete tech tree for Phoenix Point.
Visit [Fandom wiki](https://phoenixpoint.fandom.com/) for [the image](https://phoenixpoint.fandom.com/wiki/File:Sheepy_Tech_Tree.gif).

The source code of my tech tree is in the [Tech Tree folder](https://github.com/Sheep-y/PhoenixPt-Mods/tree/master/TechTree).
It is charted with [UMLet](https://www.umlet.com/). SVG available.
Yeah.
Was supposed to be a draft.
Except that I have no plan to properly redo it.
Feel free to pick it up and carry on.
